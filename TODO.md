# TODO 
- Splash screen with quick tutorial
- Popup explaining warp/ascension
- Win condition screen
- Playtesting current balance changes
- hide prestige panel before tree isn't maxed in Tier 1 before ascension
- Tier 2 change reqs for both nodes to be the last of Tier 1
- Removing the words "Ascension" and "Ascend" and replace it with a thematically fitting term (similar to prestige => warp)
- replace offline progression node from ascension tree because that would encourage offline play
- Add Achievements (no unlocks for this project unless people like it and want more from the game)
- Nodes that aren't just flat multipliers
-- multi based on energy/time/num max nodes
-- exponential boosts
-- another rebalance would be needed
- Maybe: Add dev tools (like immediately start with one ascension point)
- Display the tier number instead of the amount of warps done
-
